# Vibration-Project
This report presents a dynamic analysis of a high-rise building subjected to vibration, focusing on the implementation of Rayleigh damping to estimate the system’s response. The goal is to determine mass (m), stiffness (k), natural frequencies (ωn), damping coefficients (α, β), and to evaluate the system using relative displacement analysis.
